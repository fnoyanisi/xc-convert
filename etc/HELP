1 . FILE CONVERSION
---------------------------------------
This function is used to convert XML files into CSV (Comma Separated Values)
and vice-versa.

    1.1 XML to CSV Conversion
    ---------------------------------------
    From "Select the input file" dialog, select the XML file that will be
    converted into CSV format.

    From "Select the output directory" dialog, select the the directory
    where the generated CSV file will be written into.

    1.2 CSV to XML Conversion
    ---------------------------------------
    From "Select the input file" dialog, select the CSV file that will be
    converted into XML format. There is an expected CSV format by the tool.
    If you are not sure, convert an XML file into CSV first.

    The "Type of operation" drop-down menu can be used to set the operation
    type for CSV to XML conversion.

    From "Select the output directory" dialog, select the the directory
    where the generated CSV file will be written into.

2. PARAMETER AUDIT
---------------------------------------
At the moment, this function does not support CSV file format, hence all
the input files have to be in XML format.

From "Select the reference file" dialog, locate the file that contains
the configuration of the reference cell-site for the audit operation. In
case the configuration file includes multiple managed-objects for a certain
managed-object class, the first one that is parsed by the tool is taken as
the "reference" and the rest are ignored. e.g. if the configuration XML file
includes settings for three cells (Cell1, Cell2, Cell3), only the data for
the first cell is parsed and the rest will be ignored. In this case, the
"reference" cell object will be "Cell1"

"Select the target file" dialog lets you locate the XML file which includes
the configuration of the managed-objects you want the audit for. Parameters
of all the objects under each managed-object class contained in this file
will be compared against the "reference" object. If a managed-object class
is not included in the "reference", it is ignored.

From "Select the output directory" dialog, select the the directory
where the generated CSV file will be written into.
